## Learning Plan

- **Week 1**: Focus on Data Structures (Stack, Queue, HashMap)
- **Week 2**: Learn basic Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
- **Week 3**: Practice GIT commands and basics of Docker
- **Week 4**: Start Operating Systems basics and SQL queries
- **Week 5**: Dive into Networking basics and explore Node.js event loop

## How to Use This Repo

- Each folder contains detailed notes, examples, and resources related to the topic.
- Progress is documented in this `README.md` file.

## Additional Resources

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for practicing DSA.
